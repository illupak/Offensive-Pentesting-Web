# OS-command Injection
An OS command injection is a web security vulnerability that enables the execution of unauthorized operating system commands. An OS command injection vulnerability arises when a web application sends unsanitized, unfiltered system commands to be executed. Due to the insufficient input validation an attacker could inject their own commands to be operated on the shell level. The attacker introduces operating system commands via user- supplied data such as cookies, forms or HTTP headers.

  # Result based command Injection
  
  The output of the executed command would be visible in the response.In this attack an attacker can view the results of the command executed was success or not.
  
  <b>Scenario</b>: The application executes a shell command containing user-supplied product and store IDs, and returns the raw output from the command in its response.\
  <b>Output</b>: Here the vulnerable parameter is stored.\
  <b>Explanation</b>: Here we have used the command whoami. It displays the name of the current user.
